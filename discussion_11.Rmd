### 1. Selecting a Recommender System

For this analysis, I will choose Netflix's recommender system. Netflix is renowned for its sophisticated recommendation algorithms that personalize content for its users based on their viewing history, preferences, and interactions.

### 2. Performing Scenario Design Analysis

Given the clarified three-question framework for your scenario design analysis of Netflix's recommender system, let's restructure the analysis:

#### 1. Who are your target users?
- **Diverse Global Audience**: Netflix caters to a wide range of users with varying preferences in genres, languages, and content types.
- **Age Groups**: All age groups, with specific content tailored for children, teens, adults, and different demographic segments.
- **Tech-Savvy Viewers**: Users who prefer streaming services for entertainment and are comfortable with digital platforms.

#### 2. What are your users' goals?
- **Entertainment and Engagement**: Users primarily seek engaging and enjoyable content that aligns with their interests.
- **Discovery of New Content**: Users look to discover movies, series, and documentaries that resonate with their tastes, often beyond their regular preferences.
- **Convenience and Personalization**: Users want a seamless experience that quickly connects them with content they will likely enjoy, without the need to extensively search.

#### 3. How can you help them accomplish these goals?
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Utilizing more nuanced data (like time spent on paused content, re-watched scenes, etc.) to refine recommendations.
- **User Feedback Mechanisms**: Implementing more interactive ways for users to provide feedback on content (e.g., mood-based ratings, quick surveys post-viewing).
- **Social Features**: Introducing features like 'watch parties' or social recommendations where users can see what friends are watching or enjoying.
- **Content Discovery Features**: Adding functionalities like 'random play' based on mood/genre, and curated lists from filmmakers or actors to help users explore new content areas.

### 3. Reverse Engineering the Site

- **Interface Analysis:**
  - Personalized home screen with content recommendations.
  - Categories based on genres, trending content, and user-specific 'Because you watched' sections.
  - Rating system for users to express likes/dislikes.

- **Researching Online:**
  - Netflix uses machine learning algorithms that consider various factors such as watching history, user ratings, and the viewing habits of similar users.
  - The system also considers factors like the time of day, week, and device used for watching.

### 4. Recommendations for Improvement

- **Enhance Discovery:**
  - Introduce a feature for 'surprise me' that plays random shows/movies based on the user's mood or preferred genres.
  - Implement a 'watch with friends' feature that considers combined preferences for group recommendations.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Encourage user ratings and reviews by making this feature more prominent and engaging.
  - Include an option for users to specify why they liked or disliked a show for more nuanced recommendations.

- **Diversification:**
  - Diversify content recommendation to include lesser-known shows and movies to broaden user exposure.
  - Implement a feature that allows users to explore content based on specific themes, directors, or actors.
